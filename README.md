Crime Mapper
---
This project displays and highlights recent crimes along your route. When you see the crimes along your way, you can know which areas to avoid.

Input your start and destination locations, and Crime Mapper will draw your route with recent crime information overlayed. A heatmap can be toggled to show very clearly where the unsafe areas are. 

This project uses Node.JS, Google Maps API, and a live database of crimes for a backend, and jQuery/Bootstrap for a frontend.
